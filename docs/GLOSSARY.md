## AI & Machine Learning Terms

### API (Application Programming Interface)
A way for different software applications to communicate with each other. Think of it as a menu at a restaurant - you order (make a request) and get food (receive a response).

### Embedding
A mathematical representation of text that captures its meaning. Similar words or concepts have similar embeddings, allowing computers to understand relationships between text. For example, "dog" and "puppy" would have similar embeddings.

### GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)
A type of AI model that can generate human-like text, answer questions, write code, and perform various language tasks. GPT-4 is the latest and most capable version.

### Model
A trained AI system that can perform specific tasks. Different models are optimized for different purposes (e.g., GPT-4 for text, Whisper for speech-to-text).

### Prompt
The input text you provide to an AI model to get a response. Like asking a question or giving instructions to a colleague.

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
A technique that combines document search with AI generation. Instead of sending entire documents to AI, it finds relevant sections first, then generates answers based on those sections. This reduces costs and improves accuracy.

### Token
A unit of text that AI models process. Roughly 1 token = 4 characters or 0.75 words. "Hello world" = ~2 tokens. Token usage determines API costs.

### Vector Database
A specialized database that stores embeddings and allows fast similarity searches. Used in RAG workflows to find relevant documents quickly.

### Agent (AI Agent)
An autonomous AI system that can reason, make decisions, and take actions across multiple services. Unlike simple services, agents can orchestrate complex workflows and adapt to changing conditions.

### Autonomous System
An AI system that can operate independently, making decisions and taking actions without human intervention for each step.

### Completion
The text response generated by an AI model after processing your prompt. Also called "output" or "response."

### Context Window
The maximum amount of text (measured in tokens) that an AI model can process in a single request. GPT-4 Turbo has a 128K token context window.

### Fine-tuning
The process of training an AI model on specific data to improve its performance on particular tasks. Not commonly used with GPT models (prefer prompt engineering).

### Hallucination
When an AI model generates information that sounds plausible but is actually incorrect or made up. Important to verify AI-generated content.

### Inference
The process of using a trained AI model to generate predictions or responses. When you call an API, you're performing inference.

### Large Language Model (LLM)
A type of AI model trained on vast amounts of text data that can understand and generate human-like text. GPT-4 is an example of an LLM.

### Temperature
A parameter that controls the randomness of AI responses. Lower values (0-0.3) produce more deterministic, focused responses. Higher values (0.7-1.0) produce more creative, varied responses.

### Top-p (Nucleus Sampling)
A parameter that controls diversity by considering only tokens with cumulative probability up to a threshold. Works together with temperature to control response creativity.

## OpenAI Platform Terms

### Batch Processing
Processing multiple requests together at a lower cost (50% reduction). Useful for high-volume operations that don't need immediate responses.

### Chat Completion
An API call where you send messages (like a conversation) and receive a text response from the AI model.

### DALL-E
OpenAI's image generation model. Can create images from text descriptions.

### Assistants API
OpenAI's API for creating persistent AI assistants with memory, tools, and file handling capabilities. Allows creating assistants that can remember context across conversations.

### Function Calling
A feature that allows AI models to request structured data or trigger specific functions, making it easier to integrate AI into applications. The model can decide when to call functions based on the conversation context.

**Example:** An AI assistant could call a `getWeather` function when asked "What's the weather today?" instead of trying to generate weather data.

### JSON Mode
A feature that forces AI models to return responses in valid JSON format, making it easier to parse and use programmatically. Ensures responses are always valid JSON, reducing parsing errors.

**Example:** Instead of getting "The user is John, age 30", you get `{"name": "John", "age": 30}`.

### Max Tokens
The maximum number of tokens the AI should generate in its response. Prevents runaway costs and ensures responses fit within limits. Important for cost control.

**Example:** Setting `max_tokens: 100` limits responses to approximately 75 words.

### Moderation API
An OpenAI service that checks content for safety, identifying potentially harmful or inappropriate content. Used before displaying user-generated content or AI responses.

**Example:** Checking if a user's comment contains hate speech before posting it.

### Rate Limit
A restriction on how many API requests you can make in a certain time period. Prevents abuse and ensures fair usage. Different tiers have different limits.

**Example:** Tier 1 might allow 500 requests per minute, while Tier 2 allows 5,000.

### Streaming
Receiving responses in real-time as they're generated, rather than waiting for the complete response. Provides better user experience for long responses. Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE).

**Example:** Instead of waiting 10 seconds for a complete response, users see text appearing word-by-word as it's generated.

### System Message
A special message in a conversation that sets the AI's behavior, role, or instructions. Helps guide the AI's responses. Not visible to end users, only used to configure the AI.

**Example:** "You are a helpful assistant that explains technical concepts in simple terms."

### User Message
A message from the user in a conversation with an AI model. The input that triggers an AI response.

### Assistant Message
A message from the AI model in a conversation. The output/response from the AI.

### Temperature Parameter
Controls the randomness/creativity of AI responses. Lower values (0-0.3) = more focused and deterministic, higher values (0.7-1.0) = more creative and varied.

**Example:** 
- Temperature 0.2: "The sky is blue." (consistent, factual)
- Temperature 0.9: "The sky paints itself in shades of cerulean and azure." (creative, varied)

### Vision API

**Example:** Converting a meeting recording (MP3) into a text transcript for analysis.

## Architecture & Design Patterns

### Circuit Breaker
A pattern that prevents cascading failures by stopping requests to a failing service temporarily, giving it time to recover. Like an electrical circuit breaker that trips when overloaded.

**Example:** If an API fails 5 times in a row, the circuit breaker "opens" and stops sending requests for 30 seconds, then tries again.

### Controller
A class in ASP.NET Core that handles HTTP requests and returns responses. Controllers define API endpoints. Part of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.

**Example:** A `RequirementsController` might have methods like `Summarize()` and `GenerateUserStories()` that handle different API endpoints.

### DTO (Data Transfer Object)
A simple object used to transfer data between layers of an application. Contains only data, no business logic. Used to transfer data between API and business logic layers.

**Example:** A `UserDto` might contain `{ "id": 1, "name": "John", "email": "john@example.com" }` without any methods or business rules.

### Exponential Backoff
A retry strategy where the wait time between retries increases exponentially (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, etc.). Prevents overwhelming failing services. More sophisticated than fixed delays.

**Example:** Retry after 1 second, then 2 seconds, then 4 seconds, then 8 seconds, up to a maximum delay.

### Factory Pattern
A design pattern that creates objects without specifying the exact class. Provides a way to create objects based on conditions.

### Repository Pattern
A design pattern that abstracts data access logic. Provides a consistent interface for accessing data regardless of the underlying storage.

### Service Pattern
A design pattern where business logic is organized into service classes. Services are injected into controllers via dependency injection.

### Singleton Pattern
A design pattern where only one instance of a class exists throughout the application lifetime.

### SOLID Principles
Five design principles for object-oriented programming:
- **S**ingle Responsibility: Each class should have one reason to change
- **O**pen/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **L**iskov Substitution: Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes
- **I**nterface Segregation: Many specific interfaces are better than one general interface
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

## Technical Concepts

### Authentication
The process of verifying who you are. API keys and JWT tokens are forms of authentication. Answers "Who are you?"

**Example:** Providing an API key to prove you're authorized to use the service.

### Authorization
The process of determining what you're allowed to do after you've been authenticated. Answers "What can you do?"

**Example:** After authenticating, checking if a user has permission to delete a resource.

### Caching
Storing frequently accessed data in memory for faster retrieval. Reduces API calls and improves performance. Can be in-memory or distributed.

**Example:** Caching user profile data so it doesn't need to be fetched from the database on every request.

### Chunking
Breaking large documents into smaller pieces for processing. Used in RAG to handle large documents efficiently. Important for token optimization.

**Example:** Splitting a 100-page document into 50 chunks of 2 pages each for processing.

### Correlation ID
A unique identifier attached to requests that allows tracking a request across multiple services and systems. Essential for debugging distributed systems. Appears in all logs related to that request.

**Example:** A request ID like `abc-123-xyz` that appears in API logs, database logs, and error messages for the same request.

### CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
A security feature that allows web applications running on one domain to access resources from another domain. Required for web apps to call APIs. Configured on the server side.

**Example:** Allowing `https://myapp.com` to call `https://api.example.com` by configuring CORS headers.

### Health Check
An endpoint that reports whether a service is running and healthy. Used by monitoring systems and load balancers. Returns simple status information.

**Example:** `GET /health` returns `{ "status": "healthy", "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z" }`.

### Logging
Recording events and information about application behavior. Helps with debugging and monitoring. Can be structured or unstructured.

**Example:** Logging when an API request is received, processed, and completed, along with any errors.

### Metrics
Quantitative measurements about system performance, such as request counts, response times, and error rates. Used for monitoring and alerting.

**Example:** Tracking "requests per second", "average response time", and "error rate percentage".

### Rate Limiting
Controlling how many requests can be made in a time period to prevent overload and ensure fair usage. Can be per-user, per-IP, or global.

**Example:** Limiting each API key to 100 requests per minute.

### Retry Logic
Automatically retrying failed requests with exponential backoff (waiting longer between each retry). Handles temporary failures gracefully. Should have a maximum retry count.

**Example:** If an API call fails, retry after 1 second, then 2 seconds, then 4 seconds, up to 3 attempts total.

### Semantic Search
Searching for information based on meaning rather than exact word matches. Uses embeddings to find conceptually similar content. More powerful than keyword search.

**Example:** Searching for "canine" will also find documents about "dogs" and "puppies" because they have similar meanings.

### Structured Logging
Logging in a format (like JSON) that makes it easy for machines to parse and analyze. Better than plain text logs. Enables better searching and filtering.

**Example:** `{"timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z", "level": "Error", "message": "API call failed", "userId": 123}` instead of "Error: API call failed for user 123".

### Token Bucket
An algorithm for rate limiting that allows bursts of requests up to a limit, then enforces a steady rate. More flexible than fixed rate limiting.

**Example:** Allowing 10 requests immediately, then 1 request per second after that, up to a maximum of 100 requests per minute.

### Aggregation
Combining multiple data points into summary statistics (like averages, sums, counts).

### Alerting
Automated notifications when metrics exceed thresholds or errors occur. Helps teams respond quickly to issues.

### Anomaly Detection
Identifying unusual patterns or outliers in data. Can indicate problems or opportunities.

### Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
Tools and practices for monitoring application performance, including response times, error rates, and resource usage.

### Distributed Tracing
Tracking requests as they flow through multiple services. Essential for debugging microservices.

### Log Aggregation
Collecting logs from multiple sources into a central location for analysis and searching.

### Metrics Collection
Gathering quantitative measurements about system performance, such as request counts, response times, and error rates.

### Observability

### Performance Monitoring
Tracking how well an application performs, including response times, throughput, and resource usage.

### Telemetry
Data collected about system behavior, including logs, metrics, and traces. Used for monitoring and debugging. The umbrella term for all observability data.

## Workflow Terms

### CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)
Automated processes that test code changes and deploy them to production environments.

### Acceptance Criteria
Conditions that must be met for a user story or feature to be considered complete. Defines "done." Usually written as a bulleted list.

**Example:** For a login feature: "User can enter email and password", "System validates credentials", "User is redirected to dashboard on success".

### Backlog
A prioritized list of work items (user stories, bugs, tasks) that need to be completed. The product backlog contains all work, while the sprint backlog contains work for the current sprint.

**Example:** A backlog might contain 50 user stories, prioritized by business value.

### Burndown Chart
A graph showing remaining work over time. Used to track sprint progress. Shows if the team is on track to complete sprint goals.

**Example:** A line chart showing work remaining decreasing from 40 story points to 0 over 2 weeks.

### Epic
A large body of work that can be broken down into smaller user stories. Spans multiple sprints. Too large to complete in a single sprint.

**Example:** "User Authentication System" is an epic that contains user stories like "Login", "Password Reset", "Two-Factor Authentication".

### Kanban
A workflow management method that visualizes work on a board with columns (To Do, In Progress, Done). Focuses on continuous flow rather than sprints.

**Example:** A board with columns: "Backlog", "To Do", "In Progress", "Code Review", "Testing", "Done".

### Retrospective
A meeting at the end of a sprint where the team reflects on what went well and what could be improved. Also called "retro". Focuses on process improvement.

**Example:** Team discusses: "What went well?", "What could be improved?", "Action items for next sprint".

### Scrum
An agile framework for managing work, typically in 2-4 week sprints with daily standups and retrospectives. Includes specific roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team) and ceremonies.

**Example:** A team using Scrum has 2-week sprints, daily 15-minute standups, sprint planning, and retrospectives.

### Sprint
A time-boxed period (usually 2-4 weeks) in agile development where a team works on a set of features. The work is planned at sprint planning and reviewed at sprint review.

**Example:** A 2-week sprint where the team commits to completing 5 user stories.

### Sprint Planning
A meeting at the start of a sprint where the team plans what work will be completed. Team selects items from the backlog and commits to completing them.

**Example:** Team reviews backlog, estimates effort, and selects user stories for the next 2-week sprint.

### Standup
A short daily meeting (usually 15 minutes) where team members share what they did, what they're doing, and any blockers. Also called "daily scrum". Should be brief and focused.

**Example:** Each team member answers: "What did I do yesterday?", "What will I do today?", "Are there any blockers?"

### User Story
A description of a feature from the user's perspective, typically in the format: "As a [user type], I want [goal], so that [benefit]." Focuses on user value rather than technical implementation.

**Example:** "As a business analyst, I want to generate user stories from requirements documents, so that I can save time and ensure consistency."

### Velocity
A measure of how much work a team completes in a sprint, used for planning future sprints. Usually measured in story points or hours.

**Example:** If a team completes 20 story points per sprint on average, they can plan future sprints assuming similar capacity.

## Cost & Performance Terms

### Cost per Token
The price charged by OpenAI for processing tokens. Different models have different costs. Input and output tokens may have different prices.

**Example:** GPT-4 Turbo costs ~$10 per 1M input tokens and ~$30 per 1M output tokens.

### Latency
The time it takes for a request to complete. Lower latency means faster responses. Measured from request sent to response received.

**Example:** An API call that takes 500ms has lower latency than one that takes 2 seconds.

### P50/P95/P99 Latency
Percentile measurements of latency that show the distribution of response times:
- **P50 (Median)**: 50% of requests complete faster than this - the typical response time
- **P95**: 95% of requests complete faster than this - most requests are faster
- **P99**: 99% of requests complete faster than this - almost all requests are faster

**Example:** If P95 latency is 1 second, 95% of requests complete in under 1 second, but 5% take longer.

### Throughput
The number of requests a system can handle per unit of time. Higher throughput means more capacity. Usually measured in requests per second (RPS) or queries per second (QPS).

**Example:** A system with 1000 RPS throughput can handle 1000 requests every second.

### Token Budget
A limit on token usage to control costs. Important for managing API expenses. Can be daily, monthly, or per-request.

**Example:** Setting a daily token budget of 1M tokens to prevent unexpected costs.

### Token Usage
The number of tokens consumed by API calls. Determines costs and rate limits. Includes both input (prompt) and output (completion) tokens.

**Example:** A request with 100 input tokens and 50 output tokens uses 150 total tokens.

### Token Optimization
Techniques to reduce token usage, such as chunking documents, using RAG, or choosing smaller models. Can reduce costs by 80-88% in some cases.

**Example:** Instead of sending a 10,000-token document, use RAG to send only the 500 most relevant tokens.

## Understanding the Project Structure

### Solution (.sln file)
A container that organizes multiple related projects. Like a folder that holds all the pieces of a larger application.

### Project (.csproj file)
A single application or library. Each project has its own purpose (e.g., API, core logic, tests).

### Namespace
A way to organize code and avoid naming conflicts. Like folders for code.

### Class
A blueprint for creating objects in object-oriented programming. Defines properties and behaviors.

### Method/Function
A block of code that performs a specific task. Can be called to execute that task.

### Service
A class that provides specific functionality to other parts of the application. Follows the "service pattern" for organization.

### Controller
A class that handles HTTP requests and returns responses. Controllers define API endpoints.

### Model
In MVC architecture, a class that represents data and business logic. Different from AI "model."

### View
In MVC architecture, the presentation layer that displays data to users. In APIs, views are replaced by JSON responses.

### Shared Library
A project containing reusable code that multiple other projects can reference. The `OpenAIShared` library is an example.
